      <i>Remedium Pro Damnatis</i>
       <br />
      Spring 2025
      <br /> <br />
      Remedium Pro Damnatis (Latin: "Remedy for the Damned") is an artist's sculptural book about survival explored through the pharmaceutical ritual of swallowing pills. 
      The piece contains 50 excerpts of original poetry/prose encased in silver gelatin capsules, handwritten on pages torn directly from my personal journal. 
      It explores the consumption of hard truths and the futile attempts to prolong an inevitable ending through artificial remedies. 
      To access the text, the viewer must break the capsule — an action that cannot be undone. 
      <br /> <br />
      Technically, the pills of this book are fully edible. Though alike their written content, you may find them hard to swallow.
      This is the first piece in a larger project titled Exit Wounds.
      <br /> <br />
      Materials: Silver-coated gelatin capsules, handwritten ink on paper, glass apothecary jar, digital print (label)

      <i>1-800-DELIVR-ME</i>
       <br />
      Spring 2025
      <br /> <br />
      1-800-DELIVR-ME reforms a rotary telephone into a confessional booth. Dial a number to listen to an anonymous confession left by a stranger before you, or choose to leave your own.
      <br /> <br /> 
      The project fosters an invisible, transient link between strangers. By reducing the human identity down to only an anonymous voice contained within a machine, it removes the interference of external biases, allowing viewers to facilitate a deeper sense of empathy with the unfamiliar voice at the end of the line. 
      The sculpture creates a moment of stillness that transcends time and space, where the user is invited to share an intimate moment with a stranger who once stood in their same place, undergoing the same ritual. 
      By offering their own confession, the user becomes implicit in a larger web of shared & systemized consciousness. The user is invited to reflect upon the collective experiences and innate human emotions that bind us all together. 

      <br /> <br /> 
      The repurposing of the rotary telephone is bittersweet. This discarded analog system is granted the opportunity to continue on in its original purpose of transmitting connection, while embedding itself with entirely new memories. 
      The machine, whose only function is to archive and replay anonymous voice recordings, offers a deliberate contrast to the data & identity commodification of modern digital systems. This results in a machine that feels more intimate, and only a little more human.

      <i>5 A.R. (Anno Renascentia) / In the Glass House </i>

      <br /> <br />
      5 A.R. (Anno Renascentia), or In the Glass House, is a sculptural book reflecting on five years of survival following a distinct break in time.
      A home or building usually acts as a vault for secrets, maintaining an external image of stability 
      while obscuring what occurs within. Constructed as a transparent structure, the book subverts the architecture of privacy, exposing the taboo realities of mental illness 
      and trauma that are usually sanitized for the public eye.
      Though, there is a paradox. The laser-etched text on plexiglass remains ghost-like and difficult to read, mirroring the difficulties of trauma to be understood by outsiders, even when put on display. 
      The choice to open the "door" (cover) is always yours. But you must witness all of its wreckage at once. You cannot hide away, and you cannot unsee.
      <br /> <br />
      Materials: Laser-etched plexiglass, cyanotype prints, coptic stitch binding, yarn, tea bags, bandages, mixed media

      <i>Untitled (Love Letter to Central Park)</i>
       <br />
      Spring 2025
      <br /> <br />
      A mini love letter to Central Park. 
      The piece features dual-sided cyanotype prints, blending my own photography with found imagery. 
      The covers are constructed from wood I scavenged directly from the park grounds and sawed by hand, transforming the book into a physical memory of the landscape it documents. 
      The accordion structure allows the viewer to expand the book into a continuous, flowing panorama. 
      <br /> <br />
      Materials: Cyanotype on mixed media paper, scavenged wood (hand-sawed), acrylic gel medium
